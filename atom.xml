No matter what media or how it is called, composition is what we have to consider before we start creating art, or else the piece will not have a focal point, lacking in story-telling ability. That would not be called “creating”, that would be just “drawing”, equivalent to someone talking  without any content, just spewing noises.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Composition"><a href="#Purpose-of-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Composition"></a>Purpose of Composition</h3><p>Composing is fitting the 3D world into the 2D picture.
